WARNING:PhysDesignRules:2500 - This design does not have a PS7 block.
   Instantiate the PS7 block in order to ensure proper fabric tie-offs and
   correct operation of the processing_system7.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:2452 - The IOB f is either not constrained (LOC) to a
   specific location and/or has an undefined I/O Standard (IOSTANDARD). This
   condition may seriously affect the device and will be an error in bitstream
   creation. It should be corrected by properly specifying the pin location and
   I/O Standard.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:2452 - The IOB a is either not constrained (LOC) to a
   specific location and/or has an undefined I/O Standard (IOSTANDARD). This
   condition may seriously affect the device and will be an error in bitstream
   creation. It should be corrected by properly specifying the pin location and
   I/O Standard.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:2452 - The IOB b is either not constrained (LOC) to a

Design Summary

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    7
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                     0 out of  35,200    0%
  Number of Slice LUTs:                          1 out of  17,600    1%
    Number used as logic:                        1 out of  17,600    1%
      Number using O6 output only:               1
      Number using O5 output only:               0
      Number using O5 and O6:                    0
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   6,000    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                     1 out of   4,400    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:            1
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:             1 out of       1  100%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of       1    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:           0 out of       1    0%
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               0 out of  35,200    0%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
