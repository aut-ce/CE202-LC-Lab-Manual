## Logic Circuits Lab 09

### Goals

- How describle sequentioal logic units 
- How design flip flop
- Behavioral implementation in Verilog

### Pre-Report

### Grading Sources

* Write verilog code for falling edge d-flip-flop (***dflop_negedge.v***).

* Write verilog code for sequentioal curcuit of pre-report section (***sequentioal_circuit.v***).

* Synthesis sequentioal circuit without any error and warning.

* Save RTL Schematic of sequentioal circuit in flat mode and check its correctness.

* Complete testbench file of sequential logic as input waveform and check the correctness it by comparing with you quiz waveform (***tb_alu.v***).
